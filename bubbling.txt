Event propagation:-
*****************
Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how event propagate or travel
through DOM tree to arrive at its target and what happens to it afterward
 event propagration
*******************
1.capturing phase
2.Target phase
3.bubbling phase
capture phase:- window-->document-->html-->body-->div-->button---target
bubble phase:-target-->button-->div-->body-->html-->doucmnet-->window

Event Capturing:-
*****************
its start form window to target.In this procees to face the user so many steps it allows line by line 
In the captuirng phase,events propagate from the windows down through throughly the dom to the target node

Event bubbling
**************
**its is oppossite to event capturing
when we do something a particular event its comes as well what are the having at the top of present event
it is called a hirerachial way
if we call the child it will parent also automatically
if we call parent it does't  come child level
*child level to parent level---bubbling occurs
*parent level to child level---bubbling does'n occurs
we can revrse form the end to start taking in callback function arunmnet and pass it true

Event handling:-
*****************
-->its just action when we performance the partiular event.
   let event=document.getElementById('event1')

            event.addEventListener('click',()=>{
                console.log("event1 clicked"
Event delagation
****************
-->for a example if one event perfromce using event handling ..on that action we can profromane and come back als after completed the task



Event capturing and buubling:
**************************
How can stop this event perfomace from the start to end through the DOM-->eventpropagation()
(or)How can stop this event perofroomnce from end to start through the DOM
sometimes we have duplicates of the same events that how can we stop 
using the stopImmediatepropgation()
